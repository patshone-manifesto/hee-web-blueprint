## Architecture decisions:
An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

An architecture decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

An architecture decision log (ADL) is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).

An architecturally-significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture.

## Decision identification:
- How urgent and how important is the AD?
- Does it have to be made now, or can it wait until more is known?
- Both personal and collective experience, as well as recognized design methods and practices, can assist with decision identification.
- Ideally maintain a decision todo list that complements the product todo list.

## Decision enactment and enforcement:
- ADs are used in software design; hence they have to be communicated to, and accepted by, the stakeholders of the system that fund, develop, and operate it.
- Architecturally evident coding styles and code reviews that focus on architectural concerns and decisions are two related practices.
- ADs also have to be (re-)considered when modernizing a software system in software evolution.
