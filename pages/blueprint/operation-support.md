- Is it clear how the software provides the ability for operation/support teams to monitor and manage the system?
- How is this achieved across all tiers of the architecture?
- How can operational staff diagnose problems?
- Where are errors and information logged? (e.g. log files, Windows Event Log, SMNP, JMX, WMI, custom diagnostics, etc)
- Do configuration changes require a restart?
- Does old data need to be periodically archived?
